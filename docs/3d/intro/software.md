# 3d graphics software

In this course, we will mainly use [Blender](https://blender.org), a free and open-source 3d-graphics software that can be downloaded from [here](https://blender.org/download).

Some ore 3d-graphics suites:
- Cinema 4d
- Maya
- Modo
- 3d Max 

The previos three are general 3d-graphics software suites that bare a resemblence to Blender, but are not free. The next two are also similar, but specialize in a specific area of 3d graphics.

- Houdini - special effects, simulations etc
- zBrush - modelling, texturing

Some popular CAD software, meant to ease the process of design and drawing:

- Fusion 360
- Solidworks
- Sketchup

3D frameworks for use on the web:

- Threejs
- Aframe

And 3d-engines and software suites for game creation.
- Unity
- Unreal

[ This list is just an impression of the state of 3d right now, It is liable to change and will probably be outdated by the time of reading, for an updated list of 3D software [check out this link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_3D_modeling_software) ]
