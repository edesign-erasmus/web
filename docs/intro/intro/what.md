# What is Interactive Graphics?


## Interactive Graphics? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

First, let's talk about the term ***Interactive Graphics***. If you google it, most of the results are probably related to data analysis and infographics or maybe some (often oldschool) visualization techniques, which may be a bit confusing, because this is **NOT** what we are talking about. 

We use the term *Interactive Graphics* here, because our content correspond to specific competence standard in Estonian vocational school system, where the curriculum is named [*Interaktiivne graafika*](https://www.kutseregister.ee/ctrl/en/Standardid/vaata/10719487).  

<div class="important">

**Basically we talk about beginner/medium level WEB/UI/UX design skills with basic understanding of front-end process, markup and coding languages.**

<!-- ::: tip
Did you notice the section with a stopwatch below the main heading at the top of the page üëÜ. From this you see, how many hours every topic takes and what kind of work is planned for this. Here the stopwatch says that we'll do a very brief introduction **during 2 hours at school**. And that's it. Because you'll learn most of the things and most of the time **at your workplace**.

## User interface (UI)

<div class="important">

**A user interface (UI) is the space where interactions between humans and machines occur.**
In the era of digital machines, the user interface is most often something thet yo see on your screen. But there are some other options too...
