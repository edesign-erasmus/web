# The design process


There are certain steps, methods and tools in the designing process that help us to organize our workflow. This is also called...

## Design Thinking

<div class="important"> 

*Design thinking is a non-linear, iterative process that teams use to understand users, challenge assumptions, redefine problems and create innovative solutions to prototype and test.*

As we've seen so many times here, there's no one certain way to do things - different organisations have developed their own methologies and defined their own design thinking processes. A few examples:

- [The Hasso Plattner Institute of Design at Stanford](https://dschool.stanford.edu/resources/design-thinking-bootleg)
- [IDEO](https://designthinking.ideo.com/)
- [Zurb](https://zurb.com/process)
- etc

There is also another term we often stumble upon...

## Design Sprints

> A Design Sprint is a unique five day process for validating ideas and solving big challenges through prototyping and testing ideas with customers.<br><small><i>â€” Jake Knapp, author of "Sprint: How to Solve Big Problems and Test New Ideas in Just Five Days"</i></small>

Here is [Jake Knapp's webpage dedicated to design sprints](https://www.thesprintbook.com/the-design-sprint)

<!-- The actual design process depends on the team workflow / client / project etc, but usually these steps are involved: 

1. research / background
2. planning / ideas
3. prototyping
4. making / executing  
5. measuring / analyzing

Changing things and correct mistakes is much easier with digital products. It means, that usually teams work in loops - you should test often and early and take a step back in process, if needed.  -->

<!-- 

### 1. Define

- **client research** - today we often don't do things from scratch, but renewing or redefining existing products
- **user research** - who is our main user? what do they want?
- **market research** - what's going on out there?

### 2. Ideate

- collecting inspiration
- mindmaps
- brainstorms
- sketching

### 3. Prototype

- **lo-fi prototypes** - pen and paper or early computer wireframes
- testing
- **defining style:** color, typography, tone of voice etc
- **hi-fi prototypes** - interactive designs, Figma etc
- testing

### 4. Build

- developing, coding
- testing

### 5. Analyze

- measuring
- statistics
- testing
- **improve it!** -->
