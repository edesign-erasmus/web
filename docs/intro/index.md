## ‚úã Before we start

Should we talk a bit about the [Erasmus Edesign project](https://e-disain.eu/en/) here? Or at least mention, that these materials are part of the project. Ok, now I mentioned it. Good.

## Overview

- Right now here is one Module of the whole Interactive Graphics Curriculum.
- From the top menu ‚òù you'll find 4 learning outcomes or big Chapters of the module:
  1. **Introduction** to the subject (here we are now)
  2. UI/UX [**design basics**](../design/)
  3. Basics of [**FrontEnd**](../frontend/) developement
  4. Creating [**web graphics**](../graphics/)

Besides that, you can find a [**Introduction to 3D**](../3d/) module here.

- Once inside any of the 4 Chapters, you'll find Topics and Subtopics of each chapter from the üëà **left sidebar**.
