# Principles of UI design 

::: warning TODO üõ†Ô∏è

This should be named UI design principles and cover other principles too besides hierarchy

:::

There are some **key principles** of visual design, that we have to keep in mind while designing user interfaces. Different sources determine or name those principles little bit differently, but all of them teach us, how to **organize and emphasize the content** so that it is easier to consume.

## Visual principles:

1. **Scale**
2. **Visual hierarchy**
3. **Balance**
4. **Contrast**
5. **Gestalt**
    - similarity
    - continuation
    - closure
    - proximity

## Usability principles

Besides visual principles, there are so called usability principles. Most of them are more or less covered in our usability section, but let's remind them once again:

## Set of principles ‚Üî Design Systems

If we use a set of design principles repeatedly inside a project or different projects for the same client, we create something that is called a **design system**. (Well, if not a *whole* design system, then at least we are moving towards one.)

> A design system is a set of standards to manage design at scale by reducing redundancy while creating a shared language and visual consistency across different pages and channels.<br>[NNg: Design Systems 101](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/design-systems-101/)
