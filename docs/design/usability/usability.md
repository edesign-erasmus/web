# Usability

 

> *Usability is a measure of how well a specific user in a specific context can use a product/design to achieve a defined goal effectively, efficiently and satisfactorily.*

or just: 

<div class="important">
    
**usability means how easy and comfortable a product is to use**

</div>

Some usability aspects, like clarity, legibility, contrast, hierarchy or proximity, are common across all graphic design areas. But digital user interfaces require some extra concerns, like different screen sizes or light/brightness conditions etc.

To find out possible weak spots, it is common practice to prototype and test our product before it goes to production. Usability plays important (maybe the most important) part in overall user experience.

## 5 key points

1. **Effectiveness** â€” It supports users in completing actions accurately.
2. **Efficiency** â€” Users can perform tasks quickly through the easiest process.
3. **Engagement** â€” Users find it pleasant to use and appropriate for its industry/topic.
4. **Error Tolerance** â€” It supports a range of user actions and only shows an error in genuine erroneous situations. You achieve this by finding out the number, type and severity of common errors users make, as well as how easily users can recover from those errors.
5. **Ease of Learning** â€” New users can accomplish goals easily and even more easily on future visits.
