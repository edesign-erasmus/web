*a11y?* What [that means](https://www.boia.org/blog/what-is-a11y)? 

**Adobe XD Ideas** has also a good article: [What is Accessible Design?](https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/principles/web-design/what-is-accessible-design/)

## Disabilities

What kind of disabilites are we talking about?

1. **Visual** (e.g., color blindness)
2. **Motor/mobility** (e.g., wheelchair-user concerns)
3. **Auditory** (hearing difficulties)
4. **Seizures** (especially photosensitive epilepsy)
5. **Learning/cognitive** (e.g., dyslexia)

## Disturbed cognition

But ability barriers can arise for any user:

- **Incidental** (e.g., sleep-deprivation)
- **Environmental** (e.g., using a mobile device underground)

When some *usability* aspects may sound subjective, **accessibility** requires certain criteria or **standards**, sometimes **even law**, that designers and developers have to meet to create accessible experience for all audiences.

</div>

The **World Wide Web Consortium** (W3C) [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) is the most common and known standard for creating accessible experience. Different countries may have their own legislation acts, but they often refer to the WCAG standards.
