# UI/UX prototyping 

## What is a prototype

We have a new term here: *prototype*. What is it exactly? 

> According to Wikipedia:
> <mark>A prototype is an early sample, model, or release of a product built to **test a concept or process**.</mark>

Prototypes are made both for physical and digital products. Testing helps us discover design flaws and misunderstandings. And the earlier we test, the earlier we can find basic errors.

## LO-FI prototypes

The early-stage prototypes, where basic ideas, concepts and principles of a product is described, are called **LO-Fi prototypes**. They represent **the ideas, not always the exact look**.

Here we can see an actual LO-FI testing in progress:

### Marvel PoP

Prototyping software Marvel has an mobile app [Marvel POP](https://marvelapp.com/pop), that lets us turn paper sketches into clickable prototypes.

## Hi-Fi prototypes

Sometimes LO-FI prototypes are enough to prove a concept, but most of the time you need more advanced and polished prototypes. These are called the **HI-FI prototypes**.

While LO-FI may be done with pen and paper, HI-FI requires use of a special prototyping software. This is what our [next topic](./software.md) is about.
