# Analyzing

It very important to understand, what and why are we making, before we just start to "design stuff". Analyze! Understand the problem, do background research, if needed and so on. Some of it we discussed back in [project management](../../intro/project/project-management).

## Sitemap

One of the first thing is to find out, what kind of content we have and based on that, how many **different views** we need to create. We can do this by creating a **sitemap**.

Here are two videos: **CharliMarie** talks about how she planned her personal page, while Mr. **Kaycinho The Digital Alchemist** takes a more business-oriented approach. Both are worth looking.
