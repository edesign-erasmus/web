# Command Line Interface (CLI)

In this topic we cover main tools we use as a developer.

Let's start with **command line interface**. We focus on Linux terminal. Linux is the most widely-used operating system in web servers. We set up development environment on local machine but we want it to be as close to server configuration as possible. So Linux is obvious choice.
Mac OS will also do because it's close enough to Linux and we can use its terminal without any problems and most of the time same commands apply.
With Windows we can use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to set up Linux enviornment.

For learning Linux command line tools I recommend a Youtube course. This course will teach you the basics of Linux servers, networking, and security. First twelve sections from this video would be enough.
