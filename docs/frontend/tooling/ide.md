# IDE

IDE is an integrated development environment and it is used for software development. You can use regluar text editor for coding but as its name says IDE has a lot of plugins and features integrated specific for coding and software development that automate routine tasks and maximize productivity.

Main features of IDE are:
- **Syntax highlighting** - for language keywords, code structure and errors. Different colors are used.
- **Code completion** - some parts of the code are very repetitive, this feature helps to speed up coding.
- **Recactoring** - if we don't have syntax errors computer understands code but readability is also important for humans. This is achieved by whitespaces - spaces, tabs, new lines and empty lines. This feature can automate the process.
- **Version control** - we address version control in next topic but this feature allows automate the process of sharing code with your team.
- **Debugging** - sometimes we need to slow down the execution of program - follow instructions step by step and see what are the values of variables in certain state of program.

Currently one of the most popular IDE is **Visual Studio Code**. I recommend a Youtube video which should give you overview of VS Code but also general idea of IDE's features.
